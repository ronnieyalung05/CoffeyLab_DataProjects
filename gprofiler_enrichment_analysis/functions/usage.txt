A) run_gost_single_sample

Purpose: Run g:Profiler enrichment for one sample (protein/gene list).

User input:

Choose one sample from g_protein_list.

Choose one or more sources (GO:BP, GO:MF, KEGG, etc.).

Behavior:

Creates a gene list for that sample.

Calls gost() with retry logic for API failures.

Returns a single gost object for that sample.

Use case: Interactive exploration of one sample with multiple sources.

B) run_gost_multi_sample_one_source

Purpose: Run g:Profiler for all samples using one source.

User input:

Choose one source.

Behavior:

Loops over all samples in gpr_list.

For each sample, calls gost() separately (retry logic included).

Returns a list of gost objects, one per sample.

Use case: Compare multiple samples for a single biological source, keeping results separate.

C) run_gost_multi_sample_interactive

Purpose: Run g:Profiler for all samples, user can choose multiple sources.

User input:

Enter one or more sources (comma-separated).

Behavior:

Loops over all samples in gpr_list.

For each sample, calls gost() separately.

Returns a list of gost objects, one per sample.

Use case: Multi-sample exploration with multiple sources, keeping results separate.

D) run_gost_multi_sample_one_source_multiquery

Purpose: Run g:Profiler for all samples using one source, but in a single API call (multi_query = TRUE).

User input:

Choose one source.

Behavior:

Constructs a named list of gene vectors (one per sample).

Calls gost() once with multi_query = TRUE.

Returns a single gost object.

Each enrichment has a query column indicating the sample it came from.

Use case: Efficient multi-sample analysis for one source. Good for tables/heatmaps, less convenient for gostplot() per sample.

E) run_gost_multi_sample_interactive_multiquery

Purpose: Run g:Profiler for all samples, user can choose multiple sources, in one API call.

User input:

Enter one or more sources.

Behavior:

Creates a named list of gene vectors (one per sample).

Calls gost() once with multi_query = TRUE.

Returns a single gost object. Each enrichment includes a query column.

Use case: Efficient multi-sample, multi-source analysis. Good for combined tables, less convenient for gostplot() per sample.
